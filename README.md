## About the Project

The **Visual Optimization System** (Solver LP) is an interactive and didactic platform developed to assist in teaching and learning Operations Research. It focuses on the resolution and visualization of **Linear Programming (LP)** and **Integer Programming (IP)** problems.

Built with **Python** and **Streamlit**, the system offers rich visualizations (2D/3D charts, decision trees, step-by-step tableaux) to turn abstract mathematical concepts into tangible experiences.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 📐 Simplex
- **Step-by-Step Resolution:** Follow each iteration of the Simplex algorithm.
- **3D/2D Visualization:** Interactive charts of the feasible region identifying vertices and the solution path.
- **Interactive Tableau:** Detailed display of basic and non-basic variables and pivoting operations.
- **Case Identification:** Detects optimal solutions, multiple solutions, unbounded problems, and infeasible cases.

### 🌐 Internationalization (Multi-Language)
The project supports multiple languages via JSON files.
- **Supported Languages:** Portuguese (pt), English (en), Spanish (es).
- **Contribution:** To add a new language, simply create a `.json` file in `ui/locales/` (e.g., `fr.json`) mirroring the structure of `en.json` and submit a Pull Request. The system will automatically detect it.

### 🌳 Branch & Bound
- **Integer Programming:** Complete algorithm for solving IP problems.
- **Visual Decision Tree:** Real-time interactive graph showing nodes, prunings (bound, integrality, infeasibility), and branches.
- **Search Strategies:** Support for BFS, DFS, and Best-Bound.

### 🛠️ Analysis Tools
- **🔄 Primal-Dual Converter:** Instantly transform problems and solve the Dual.
- **📊 Sensitivity Analysis:** Calculate Shadow Prices and stability intervals for objective function coefficients ($c_j$) and constraints ($b_i$).
- **📝 Standard Form:** Automatic converter to canonical form (Maximization, Equalities, RHS $\ge$ 0) with didactic step-by-step explanation.

### 📚 Additional Resources
- **Problem Library:** Collection of classic problems (Diet, Knapsack, Production Mix) ready for testing.
- **Session History:** Your solved problems are automatically saved for comparison and review.

### 📖 Detailed Documentation
- [Features Documentation](docs/FEATURES.md) - Detailed breakdown of functional and non-functional requirements.
- [Architecture Documentation](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) - Technical decisions, structure, and diagrams (C4 Model).
